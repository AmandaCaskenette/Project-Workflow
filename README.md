# Project-Workflow
This repository contains a comprehensive R project template designed to streamline the entire research process, from idea inception to manuscript submission. The template is structured to guide researchers through hypothesis development, statistical method selection, data collection, and manuscript drafting, with automated workflows and built-in version control

## Key Features:
* Structured Workflow: Follow a step-by-step process, with prompts for each stage of the project (brainstorming, hypothesis development, statistical method selection, data collection, and manuscript writing).
* Automated Work Plan: the template generates a dynamic timeline with deadlines and mini-goals. Adjust task durations to fit your schedule.
* Statistical Planning: Select and test statistical methods before data collection. Run simulations and power analyses to determine the most appropriate methods for your research question.
* Dynamic Manuscript Drafting: Automatically pull hypotheses, statistical results, and figures into the manuscript as you work. Manuscript updates in real time as data analysis is completed.
* Version Control: Integrated with GitHub for version tracking, ensuring you can collaborate effectively and track changes over time.
* Flexible Data Handling: Designed for both real-world data and simulated data, with options to integrate custom datasets at various stages of the project.
* Searchable Notes: Save brainstorming ideas, notes, and key observations in a searchable format to include in the manuscript later.
